## About The Project

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72350887/177231344-5a8deee6-3941-4887-9cd7-0511e37891fd.png)

<p align="justify"> The sixth project at Driven Education Bootcamp. This project was the first one in group and i had the pleasure to work with Leonardo Souza. The
project, was based on the BuzzFeed page, an online quiz platform about different topics (series, politics, animals, etc.), in them you can test your knowledge for fun.
Based on this, the "BuzzQuizz" project was created, using only: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In addition to building of the entire front-end of the project, we also consume APIs through AXIOS, in order to be able to push & pull data from the server. 
This project is available for desktop, tablet and mobile, so be free to use it on every device.</p>
